3,"I think the hyhothesis might be the sound could interfere people's atteion on vusial reaction, so you were measuring if participants could make correct reaction to the position whhen hearing different length of the sound in background.","no problems with the data","Yes","the length of the sounds","the length"
4,"Seomthing to do with the noise and sound the robot makes determining how far it has moved","No","Yes","the sound"," Longer noise"
6,"if the hand shown first infulenced the decision at the end if their was a delay in processing information ","n/a","Yes","finger movement and sound","the length"
7,"I think you were trying to measure the distance with the sound.","Very long study ","No","0","0"
8,"The brains ability to both predict an outcome and recognise change","No, I was not hindered for any part of the experiment","Yes","Unidentifiable but noticeable","Length of sound and pitch"
9,"changes would be more noticable on the side of the dominant eye","n/a","No","0","0"
10,"The brain's perception of sound and movement","you can use my data","No","0","0"
11,"whether the length of the sound played had any effect on accuracy? due to the insistence that we have wired headphones and the fact that some clips felt faster than others","no reason not to use the data. I feel the exp would benefit from some sort of recognition that the space bar had been pressed. Especially at the start, i was wondering whether my clicks had registered or if i should press the space bar again to make sure","Yes","speed of the sound played","speed"
12,"to see if there was a difference in the time it took people to point out a slight difference, compared to an obvious difference ","n/a","Yes","the position of the fingers and how much of the upper arm was visible ","to see if it made a difference to the answers "
14,"less error/shorter reaction time for shorter sounds","I got very sleepy and could feel my attention drift a few times, it's a very repetitive task ","Yes","sounds and maybe size ","low frequency for longer sounds, higher frequency for shorter sounds"
15,"This is a visual test about instantaneous memory, which aims to detect the instantaneous memory ability of the human brain.","There is no problem.","Yes","No significant changes were found except for exercise","Changes in the length of the sound"
18,"To see if subtle movements were as noticeable as major ones","I though my laptop was broken so did not try in the last and final round as I assumed it waas a glitch and the experiment should have finished.","Yes","the colour/brightness","the pitch"

21,"working memory,or short-term memory ","duration of experiment is too single-based? ","Yes","there is a part of green area","fast or slow"
22,"how esay it is for someone to recongnise the movement of a robot","i do not think there is anything that effected me during this experiment. There was some flashing green at times, i am unsure if that was meant to happen or not.","Yes","the colour","unsure"
