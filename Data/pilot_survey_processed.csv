"0 = No Hypothesis guessing ability, 1 = some accurate guess, 2 = completely guessed correct",,,,,,,
,Q1,,Q2,Q3,Q4,Hypothesis Guessing Score (Q1),"Sound Detection Score (Q2,Q3,Q4)"
ID,"What do you think you think the hypothesis for this experiment was? Try to be specific about what we were measuring, and why you think we did it. ",,"Apart from the robot's motion, do you think something else changed between each of the robot's movements?",What do you think this change was?,"The factor that was changed between trials was one characteristic of the sound the robot made. ~n  Specifically, what do you think was the sound characteristic that was changed?",,
,,,,,,,
1,Nil,,No,0,0,,
2,I don't know,,No,0,0,,
3,"I think the hyhothesis might be the sound could interfere people's atteion on vusial reaction, so you were measuring if participants could make correct reaction to the position whhen hearing different length of the sound in background.",,Yes,the length of the sounds,the length,,
4,Seomthing to do with the noise and sound the robot makes determining how far it has moved,,Yes,the sound, Longer noise,,
6,if the hand shown first infulenced the decision at the end if their was a delay in processing information ,,Yes,finger movement and sound,the length,,
7,I think you were trying to measure the distance with the sound.,,No,0,0,,
8,The brains ability to both predict an outcome and recognise change,,Yes,Unidentifiable but noticeable,Length of sound and pitch,,
9,changes would be more noticable on the side of the dominant eye,,No,0,0,,
10,The brain's perception of sound and movement,,No,0,0,,
11,whether the length of the sound played had any effect on accuracy? due to the insistence that we have wired headphones and the fact that some clips felt faster than others,,Yes,speed of the sound played,speed,,
12,"to see if there was a difference in the time it took people to point out a slight difference, compared to an obvious difference ",,Yes,the position of the fingers and how much of the upper arm was visible ,to see if it made a difference to the answers ,,
14,less error/shorter reaction time for shorter sounds,,Yes,sounds and maybe size ,"low frequency for longer sounds, higher frequency for shorter sounds",,
15,"This is a visual test about instantaneous memory, which aims to detect the instantaneous memory ability of the human brain.",,Yes,No significant changes were found except for exercise,Changes in the length of the sound,,
18,To see if subtle movements were as noticeable as major ones,,Yes,the colour/brightness,the pitch,,
19,the shorter robot noise makes it harder to tell if the hand has moved ,,No,0,0,,
20,to meausre if the direction of the hadn inlfuences how accurate participants are in guessing if the second hand is placed differently or not. ,,No,0,0,,
21,"working memory,or short-term memory ",,Yes,there is a part of green area,fast or slow,,
22,how esay it is for someone to recongnise the movement of a robot,,Yes,the colour,unsure,,
24,sound and directions of movement causing biases in human reaction time,,Yes,sound,the duration of the sound,,
