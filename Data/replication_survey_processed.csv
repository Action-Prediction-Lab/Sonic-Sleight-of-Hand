,Q1,,Q2,Q3,Q4,Hypothesis Guessing Score (Q1),"Sound Detection Score (Q2,Q3,Q4)"
ID,"What do you think you think the hypothesis for this experiment was? Try to be specific about what we were measuring, and why you think we did it. ",,"Apart from the robot's motion, do you think something else changed between each of the robot's movements?",What do you think this change was?,"The factor that was changed between trials was one characteristic of the sound the robot made. ~n  Specifically, what do you think was the sound characteristic that was changed?",,
1,I don't know,,No,0,0,,
2,I am not sure ,,Yes,Hand,I did not notice,,
4,Perpahs a corelation between sound and movement,,No,0,0,,
6,I think that the experiment was about the way that human's brain interact with moving pictures and sound stimulation at the same time.,,No,0,0,,
7,Whether right or left orientation has an effect on observational awareness and accuracy.,,Yes,Position of the fingers,The squeaky noise,,
8,"Think hypothesis might be that you expect us to overestimate the movement of the hand in the direction it is moving, as we may subconsciously expect continued movement after hand disapears. Maybe measuring if less accurate to left or right of original position of hand.",,No,0,0,,
10,I think the experiment is probably about evaluating the short term memory of people and also the duration of concentration like how much time a human can concentrate on the same task. I think it is specifically done to measure the concentration and the short term memory.,,No,0,0,,
11,If I can be fooled into thinking it had moved?,,No,0,0,,
13,picture perfect memory ,,No,0,0,,
14,I think it is something to do with whether the length of the sound played would trick me into thinking the hand had moved further or less than it acually had,,No,0,0,,
15,I think you tried to check if the sound of the moving hand would trick me into thinking wheter the hand moved more or less from the last position,,Yes,the sound,sometimes it was shorter sometimes longer than the real movement,,
16,I have no idea,,No,0,0,,
17,i think that you are interested in the movement/sound relationship,,Yes,quickness of movement,i don't know,,
19,i have no idea,,No,0,0,,
20,"I think you're measuring percieved travel distance, and memory of spacial awareness. Not sure for what reason though",,No,0,0,,
21,attention to detail,,No,0,0,,
22,it might about the attension of chages in the object and to help set of people who struggling with defect identifying length,,Yes,wrist rotation while moving,no idea,,
23,"measuring accuracy based on the direction the hand goes in, if we are more likely to be correct if the direction is in our handedness",,Yes,the position of the hand and whether it was open or slightly closed.,it changed from a kerching to more of a bleep maybe.,,
24,I thnik that the hypothesis of this experiment was that the subject's visual perception of hand positioning would differ based on the different audio length assigned to each of the hand's movement  ,,No,0,0,,
25,"I realy do not know,for surgery, maybe",,Yes,movements,longer and higher sound,,
27,I think this experiment was about memory and our persistence of vision.I  don't really know why you did it.,,No,0,0,,
28,I think the experiment is to teach a A.I.,,No,0,0,,
29,pthe hypothesis is people cannot notice a difference when there the objet move in a small distance. You are trying to measure the actual distance that people cannot notice the difference of the distance that people notice the difference,,No,0,0,,
30,no idea,,Yes,A green line flashed sometimes,I did not notice,,
31,To determine whether people are influenced by the direction of the hands movement. So do people get more correct when the hand is moving to the left for example.,,No,0,0,,
32,"Maybe test if the movement of a robotic hand, confuses people more than the movement of an actual hand.",,Yes,The structure of the arm,i don't know,,
