# Consequential sound induces illusory distortions in the perception and prediction of robot motion
 
This repository contains the experiment and analysis scripts showing that manipulations to the consequential sound of a robot can shift a human interaction partners visual perception, and future prediction of robot motion. 

The goal of this repository is so that researchers are able to fully replicate our work, and adapt it to suit their needs.
